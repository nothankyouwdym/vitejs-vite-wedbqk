            Hey, my name is Boubacar I am 12 years old. I started coding at the age of 10 starting with the language C.
            After a bit of making stuff I decided to learn Java. After a while I decided to do a course on C++ and make stuff with that. When I turned 11 I decided I wanted a break so I took some time off then once I finished I took a CS50 course and learned C again. I kept on using C until a couple months from now. I learned HTML,CSS amd JavaScript. Finally when I finished learning I decided to learn React.JS and now here I am.
